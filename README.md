# PdfTableExtractor
How this app works:
You upload a pdf file. The app finds the relevant pages. The user then selects the page they like. The app converts that page into a canvas. The user then draws a rectangle around the relevant tables existing on that page. The code then extracts the information from that table and uploads it to a sql database.
